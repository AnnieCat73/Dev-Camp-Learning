## Overview

I had an idea for a fictional landing page for an online course platform specialising in Web Development. I designed and coded it from scratch into a responsive live website.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
-Navigate between sections and/or pages.
- Send email via the form in the contact section.

## My process

- Planning – who is this website for and its goals and target audience?
- How can I accomplish its goal through my development and design options!
- Draw mockups of components and sitemap, then decide which section and content to keep.
- Which responsive layout pattern serves each section best, CSS Grid or Flexbox?
- Are there any reusable components or classes we can use?
- Mobile-first approach. I used CSS resets and CSS variables, then set global styles, utility classes, typography and layouts for each section.
- Javascript added for interactivity.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS resets
- CSS custom properties
- utility classes and reusable components
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript for menu, carousel and sign up form

### What I learned

After completing this project from scratch my CSS layout skills improved a lot and I got a lot of good practice in how to build and complete a project from the beginning to the end. This project was also a good way to incorporate utility classes to my CSS file.
### Continued development

I will continue to improve with my layout skills. My aim is to get more comfortable with CSS grid and add more Javascript for functionality!

### Useful resources

- This landing page was inspired by what I was taught in Kevin Powell’s CSS Demystified course. This course improved my CSS skills! My layout skills are transformed and I am forever grateful!
