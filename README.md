## Overview

A responsive photo gallery created using CSS Grid

### The challenge

Creating a fun and simple responsive image gallery using CSS Grid.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

- I wanted to create a responsive image gallery with CSS Grid.
- The gallery was populated with images from Unsplash.com.
- The gallery has different kinds of images.
- If you refresh the page the gallery will upload new images for each image category.
- By hovering over an image you will see which category it belongs to while it also animates!


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- CSS animation


### What I learned

I found this to be a good use case for CSS Grid. 

### Continued development

I will continue to improve my layout skills and get more comfortable with CSS Grid.
